6. React (The [documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) is all important, but the following are some information I had to keep looking at frequently.)
    - [Higher-Order-Components](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html)
    - [React Life Cycle Methods](https://programmingwithmosh.com/javascript/react-lifecycle-methods/)

### Comments
Frankly, this project was made to learn more about redux, but I feel that this couldve been done very easily with just the Context API.
